"""Runs tests/engine and tests/unit against libmodsecurity, gated by compat/known-gaps.md.

Gating (ADR-0023): a file without a known-gaps row for this engine must pass entirely; a
file with a row may fail (failures are printed as expected); a file with a row that passes
entirely fails with "known-gaps row is obsolete".
