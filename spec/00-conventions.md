# 00. Conventions

This specification describes SecLang, the rule language shared by ModSecurity v2,
libmodsecurity v3, Coraza and any future engine. It standardizes what the engines
already agree on and, where they diverge, records a decision as an ADR in `adr/`.

## Requirement words

"MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" are used as defined in RFC 2119
and RFC 8174, and carry that meaning only when written in capitals.

## Feature status

Every directive, variable, operator, transformation, action and `ctl:` option in this
specification is a *feature* and carries exactly one status, written on the line
directly after its heading as `**Status:** <value>`:

| Status            | Meaning for an implementing engine |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Core`            | MUST be implemented as specified. Conformance requires every Core feature. Every Core feature has at least one test in `tests/`. |
| `Extended`        | SHOULD be implemented. Fully specified. An engine declares which Extended features it supports; tests for them carry `requires:` so other engines skip them. |
| `Deprecated`      | MUST be accepted by the parser. MAY be ignored with a warning. MUST NOT be used in new rulesets. |
| `Engine-specific` | Listed so the name is reserved. Not specified here; another engine MUST NOT give the name different semantics. |

The initial Core set is the intersection of the three surveyed engines, restricted to
features used by OWASP CRS v4 or by the engines' recommended configuration files.
Promoting a feature to Core needs an ADR (see ADR-0001).

## Spec versioning

The specification is versioned `vMAJOR.MINOR`. Adding features, or moving a feature
between `Extended`, `Deprecated` and `Engine-specific`, is a MINOR change. Changing the
semantics of a Core feature, or promoting to or demoting from Core, is MAJOR and
requires an ADR.

## Conformance statement

An engine conforms to `seclang-spec vX.Y` when it passes every test under `tests/` that
is not skipped by a `requires:` clause for an Extended feature it does not declare.
Core tests can never be skipped.

## Reading this document

Each feature section is organized as: **Syntax**, **Default** (where applicable),
**Scope** (where a directive may appear), **Semantics**, **Divergence notes** (links to
ADRs), **Tests** (paths under `tests/`).

## Source anchors

Tests reference features by `NN-file.md#anchor`, where `anchor` is the GitHub heading
slug: lowercase the heading, drop every character that is not a letter, digit, space or
hyphen, then replace spaces with hyphens. `tools/validate.py` enforces that every
reference resolves and every Core feature is referenced.
