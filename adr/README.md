# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records a decision about the SecLang specification: what was decided, which
alternatives existed, and why. Write one whenever the engines disagree and the spec
has to pick (Divergence), when behaviour is undocumented but agreed (Clarification),
when a legacy feature is retired (Deprecation), or when an engine-specific feature is
promoted into the spec (Extension).

## Process

1. Copy `0000-template.md` to `NNNN-short-slug.md` with the next free number.
2. Fill every header field. `Status` is `proposed` until maintainers of at least two
   implementing engines agree, then `accepted`. `superseded` and `rejected` are terminal.
3. A `Divergence` ADR must list at least one test under `## Tests` that encodes the
   outcome. The validator checks the paths exist.
4. Add a row to the index below. `uv run python tools/validate.py` fails if a file and the
   index disagree.
5. Update the affected section of `spec/` in the same PR.
